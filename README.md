# Monte Carlo Simulation for Pi
Contains the following:
  1. A serial approach to the estimation of Pi using the Monte Carlo Method (C++)
  2. A Multithreaded estimation of Pi based on the Monte Carlo Method (C++)
  3. Using matplotlib, plots the estimated value of Pi using Monte Carlo Method (Python)
  
(Working on parallelization using OpenMP and MPI)
